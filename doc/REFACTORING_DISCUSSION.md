## Initial Discussion  
The two primary design issues we currently have are duplication in the backend and the reference to 
frontend features in places that should not be worried about the GUI. We would like to focus our work 
during this lab to solving some of these issues, perhaps by using interfaces where possible and defining 
clearer packages. Another potential area of focus is our implementation of the Grid; as Professor Duvall 
suggested, we would like to pass around a grid object as opposed to a 2D array list.
